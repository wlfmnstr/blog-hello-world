# About This Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is our internal documentation and knowledge sharing platform. It's designed to make it easy for everyone on the team to contribute, find, and maintain documentation.

## Purpose

We created this system to:

- Centralize internal documentation
- Make knowledge sharing accessible to all team members
- Provide both visual and code-based editing
- Maintain documentation close to the code (in Git)
- Enable fast, reliable deployment

## Technology

Built with modern web technologies:

- **Astro 4.x**: Fast, content-focused framework
- **React**: Interactive components where needed
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Tina CMS**: Visual content editor
- **GitHub**: Version control and hosting
- **Pagefind**: Fast static search

## Architecture

Our knowledge base follows a GitHub-first architecture:

- Content stored as MDX files in Git
- Tina CMS commits directly via GitHub API
- GitHub Actions handles build and deployment
- GitHub Pages hosts the static site
- No external services or databases needed

## Contributing

Everyone on the team can contribute:

- **Non-technical**: Use Tina CMS at `/admin`
- **Technical**: Edit MDX files directly and commit

All contributions go through Git, providing full version history and the ability to review changes.

## Support

If you need help or have questions:

1. Check the [documentation](/docs)
2. Search for existing answers
3. Ask in the team chat
4. Create an issue in the repository

## Roadmap

Future improvements we're considering:

- Additional MDX components
- Enhanced search features
- Content templates
- Collaborative editing
- Integration with other tools

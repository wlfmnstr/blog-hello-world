# Content Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to create consistent, high-quality content for the knowledge base.

## Writing Style

### Clarity First

- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define technical terms on first use
- Write for your audience

### Structure

- Start with a clear introduction
- Use headings to organize content
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences)
- Use lists for multiple items

### Tone

- Professional but friendly
- Active voice preferred
- Second person ("you") for instructions
- Present tense for current information

## Formatting

### Headings

Use semantic heading hierarchy:

```markdown
# Page Title (H1 - only one per page)
## Main Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
#### Minor Section (H4)
```

### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### Links

Use descriptive link text:

- Good: "Read the [deployment guide](/docs/deployment)"
- Bad: "Click [here](/docs/deployment)"

## Content Types

### Blog Posts

- Announcements and updates
- Feature spotlights
- Team news
- Use tags for categorization

### Documentation

- How-to guides
- Technical references
- API documentation
- Organized by category

### Pages

- Static content (About, Contact, etc.)
- Landing pages
- General information

## Frontmatter Requirements

### Blog Posts

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Brief description"
pubDate: 2025-11-05
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
draft: false
---
```

### Documentation

```yaml
---
title: "Doc Title"
description: "Brief description"
order: 1
category: "Category Name"
---
```

## Images

- Store images in `/public/uploads/`
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images before uploading
- Always include alt text

```markdown
![Alt text description](/uploads/image-name.jpg)
```

- [ ] All required frontmatter fields present

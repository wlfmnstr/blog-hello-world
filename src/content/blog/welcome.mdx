# Welcome to Our Knowledge Base

We're excited to introduce our new internal knowledge base system! This platform is designed to make it easy for everyone on the team to create, share, and find documentation.

## Key Features

- **Dual Editing**: Edit content visually with Tina CMS or directly in your IDE
- **Fast Search**: Find what you need instantly with Cmd/Ctrl+K
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes with automatic theme switching
- **MDX Support**: Rich content with React components

## Getting Started

### For Content Creators

1. Visit `/admin` to access the Tina CMS editor
2. Create or edit content with a familiar, Notion-like interface
3. Save and publish instantly

### For Developers

1. Clone the repository
2. Edit `.mdx` files directly in your favorite editor
3. Commit and push - GitHub Actions handles the rest

## What's Next?

Check out our [documentation](/docs) to learn more about how to use the system, or explore the [blog](/blog) for announcements and updates.

Happy documenting!

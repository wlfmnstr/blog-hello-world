Perform a comprehensive code review:

1. Run `git diff` to see recent changes
2. Check code follows TypeScript and Astro conventions
3. Verify proper error handling
4. Ensure accessibility basics (semantic HTML, keyboard nav)
5. Review for performance issues
6. Confirm dark mode compatibility
7. Validate that changes integrate properly

Provide feedback with specific file:line references and improvement suggestions.

Update CLAUDE.md with any new patterns discovered.
